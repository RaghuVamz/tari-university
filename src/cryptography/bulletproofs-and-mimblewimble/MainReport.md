## Introduction

Bulletproofs form part of the family of distinct Zero-knowledge Proof<sup>[def][zk~]</sup> systems, like Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), Succinct Transparent ARgument of Knowledge (STARK) and Zero Knowledge Prover and Verifier for Boolean Circuits (ZKBoo). Zero-knowledge proofs are designed so that a prover is able to indirectly verify that a statement is true without having to provide any information beyond the verification of the statement, for example to prove that a number is found that solves a cryptographic puzzle and fits the hash value without having to reveal the nonce<sup>[def][nonce~]</sup>. ([[2]], [[4]])

Bulletproofs is a Non-interactive Zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof protocol for general Arithmetic Circuits<sup>[def][ac~]</sup> with very short proofs (Arguments of Knowledge Systems<sup>[def][afs~]</sup>) and without requiring a Trusted Setup<sup>[def][ts~]</sup>. They rely on the Discrete Logarithmic<sup>[def][dlp~]</sup> assumption and are made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic<sup>[def][fsh~]</sup>. The name 'Bulletproof' originated from a non-technical summary from one of the original authors of the scheme's properties: "<i>Short like a bullet with bulletproof security assumptions</i>". ([[1]], [[29]])

Bulletproofs also implements a Multi-party Computation (MCP) protocol whereby distributed proofs of multiple provers with secret committed values are aggregated into a single proof before the Fiat-Shamir
challenge is calculated and sent to the verifier. Secret committed values will stay secret. ([[1]], [[6]])

The essence of Bulletproofs is its inner-product algorithm originally presented by Groth [[13]] and then further refined by Bootle et al. [[12]]. The algorithm provides an argument of knowledge (proof) of two binding vector Pedersen Commitments<sup>[def][pc~]</sup> that satisfy a given inner product relation, which is of independent interest (not related). Bulletproofs builds on these techniques, which yield communication efficient zero-knowledge proofs, but offer a further replacement for the inner product argument that reduces overall communication by a factor of three. ([[1]], [[29]])

## How does Bulletproofs work?

The basis of confidential transactions are to replace the output amounts with Pedersen commitments. It is then publicly verifiable that the transactions balance while keeping the specific committed amounts hidden, thus zero-knowledge. The transaction amounts must be encoded as $ integers \mspace{4mu} mod \mspace{4mu} q $, which can overflow, but to prevent this rangeproofs are used. Enter Bulletproofs. The essence of Bulletproofs is its ability to calculate rangeproofs from inner-products. The basic idea is to hide all the bits of the amount in a single vector Pedersen commitment, to prove that each bit satisfies $ x(x-1) = 0 $ and that they sum to v. These conditions are then expressed as an efficient simple inner product of small size that can work with Pedersen commitments.

Bulletproofs are made non-interactive using this Fiat-Shamir heuristic and only rely on the discrete logarithm assumption. What this means in practice is that Bulletproofs are compatible with any secure elliptic curve, which makes it extremely versatile. The proof size is short; only $ [2 \log_2(n) + 9] $ elements for the range proofs and $ [\log_2(n) + 13] $ elements for arithmetic circuit proofs.



## Comparison to other Zero-knowledge Proof Systems

The table below shows a high level comparison between Sigma Protocols (i.e. interactive public-coin protocols) and the different Zero-knowledge proof systems mentioned in this report. Bulletproofs is unique in that it is not interactive, has short proof size, does not require a trusted setup and is practical to implement. These attributes make Bulletproofs extremely desirable to use as rangeproofs in cryptocurrencies.

## Applications for Bulletproofs

Bulletproofs have wide application ([[3]], [[6]]) and can be efficiently used for :

- Rangeproofs
  - Rangeproofs are proofs that a secret value, which has been encrypted or committed to, lies in a certain interval. It prevents any numbers coming near the magnitude of a large prime, say $ 2^{256} $, that can cause wrap around when adding a small number, e.g. proof that $ x \in [0,2^{52} - 1] $.
- Merkle proofs
  - In this context a full node (*verifier*) maintains a complete copy of the merkle tree and a thin node (*prover*) wants to be convinced that a certain transaction <code>t</code> is included in the merkle tree in some block <code>B</code> with block header <code>H</code>.  [[7]] This proof between the *verifier* and *prover* can be done with Bulletproofs as a NIZK.
- Proof of solvency
  - Proofs of solvency are a specialized application of merkle proofs; coins can be added into a giant merkle tree. It can then be proven that some outputs are in the merkle tree and that those outputs add up to some amount that the cryptocurrency exchange claims they have have control over without revealing any private information.
- Multi-signatures with deterministic nonces
  - With bulletproofs every signatory can prove that their nonce was generated deterministically. A sha256 arithmetic circuit could be used in a deterministic way to show that the de-randomized nonces were generated deterministically. This will still work if one signatory were to leave the conversation and rejoin later on, with no memory of interacting with the other parties they were previously interacting with.
- Scriptless Scripts
  - Scriptless scripts is a way to do smart contracts exploiting the linear property of Schnorr signatures, using an older form of zero-knowledge proofs called a sigma protocol. This can now all be done with bulletproofs, which could be extended to allow assets that are functions of other assets - crypto derivatives perhaps.
- Assets / smart contracts / crypto-derivatives
  - A bulletproof can be calculated as a short proof for an arbitrary computation in a smart contract, thereby creating privacy-preserving smart contracts.

### Wallet Reconstruction - Grin

See  [[35]]

"{**yeastplume** } Single commit bullet proofs appear to be working, which is all we need. The only think I think we're missing here from being able to use this implementation is the ability to store an amount within the rangeproof (for wallet reconstruction). From conversations with @apoelstra earlier, I believe it's possible to store 64 bytes worth of 'message' (not nearly as much as the current rangeproofs). We also need to be aware that we can't rely as much on the message hiding properties of rangeproofs when switching to bullet proofs."

- "{**yeastplume** } @apoelstra the amount, and quite possibly the switch commitment hash as well (or just a hash of the entire output) as per #207..."


"{**apoelstra**} Ok, I can get you 64 bytes without much trouble (xoring them into `tau_1` and `alpha` which are easy to extract from `tau_x` and `mu` if you know the original seed used to produce the randomness). I think it's possible to get another 32 bytes into `t` but that's way more involved since `t` is a big inner product."

## Negatives

- A discrete-log attacker (*e.g. a bad actor employing a quantum computer*) would be able to exploit Bulletproofs to silently inflate any currency that used them. Bulletproofs are perfectly hiding (*i.e. confidential*), but only computationally binding (*i.e. not quantum resistant*). Unconditional soundness is lost due to the data compression being employed. ([[1]], [[5]], [[6]] and [[10]])
- 

## Conclusions, Observations, Recommendations

- BÃ¼nz B. et al [[1]] proposed that the switch commitment scheme defined by Ruffing T. et al. [[24]] can be used for Bulletproofs if doubts in the underlying cryptographic hardness (discrete log) assumption arise in future. The switch commitment scheme allows for a block chain with proofs that are currently only computationally binding to later switch to a proof system that is perfectly binding and secure against quantum adversaries, but weakening the perfectly hiding property as a drawback and slowing down all proof calculations. In this proposal all Pedersen commitments will be replaced with ElGamal Commitments<sup>[def][egc~]</sup> to move from computationally binding to perfectly binding. BÃ¼nz B. et al [[1]] also have further ideas about how the ElGamal commitments can possibly be enhanced to improve the hiding property to be statistical or perfect.

Both *binding* and *hiding* properties are then further classified in increasing levels of security to be computational, statistical or perfect. No commitment scheme can at the same time be perfectly binding and perfectly hiding. ([[36]], [[37]])

Analogously, in any group  $ G $ , powers  $ b^k $ can be defined for all integers $ k $, and the discrete logarithm $ \log_ba $ is an integer $ k $ such that $ b^k=a $. Algorithms in public-key cryptography base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen cyclic finite groups and cyclic subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields has no efficient solution.

The ElGamal encryption scheme is based on the Decisional Diffe-Hellman (DDH) assumption and the difficulty of the DLP for finite fields.  The DDH assumption states that it is infeasible for a Probabilistic Polynomial-time (PPT) adversary to solve the DDH problem. (<i>**Note:** The ElGamal encryption scheme should not be confused with the ElGamal signature scheme.</i>) ([[1]], [[43]], [[44]], [[45]])

([[18]], [[19]])
  - The prover will use a <code>Prove()</code> algorithm to calculate a commitment $ A $ with a statement $ Y $ that is shared with the verifier and a secret witness value $ w $ as inputs. The commitment $ A $ is then hashed to obtain the challenge $ c $, which is further processed with the <code>Prove()</code> algorithm to calculate the response $ f $. The single message sent to the verifier then contains the challenge $ c $ and response $ f $.
  - The verifier is then able to compute the commitment $ A $ from the shared statement $ Y $, challenge $ c $ and response $ f $. The verifier will then use a <code>Verify()</code> algorithm to verify the combination of shared statement $ Y $, commitment $ A $, challenge $ c $ and response $ f $.
  - A weak FiatâShamir transformation can be turned into a strong FiatâShamir transformation if the hashing function is applied to the commitment $ A $ and shared statement $ Y $ to obtain the challenge $ c $ as opposed to only the commitment $ A $.

- *<u>Nonce</u>*:<a name="nonce"> </a>In security engineering, nonce is an abbreviation of <i>**n**umber used **once**</i>. In cryptography, a nonce is an arbitrary number that can be used just once.

- <u><i>Pedersen Commitment</i></u>:<a name="pc"> </a>Pedersen commitments are a system for making blinded non-interactive commitments to a value. ([[1]], [[15]], [[22]], [[38]], [[39]]).
  - The generalized Pedersen commitment definition follows:
    - Let $ q $ be a large prime and $ p $ be a large safe prime such that $ p = 2q + 1 $
    - Let $ \mathbb G $ and $ \mathbb Q $ denote cyclic groups of prime order $ p $ and $ q $, and let $ \mathbb Z_p $ and $ \mathbb Z_q $ denote the ring of integers $ modulo \mspace{4mu} p $ and $ modulo \mspace{4mu} q $, respectively
    - Let $ \mathbb Z_p^* $  denote $ \mathbb Z_p \setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace $ and $ \mathbb Z_q^* $ denote $ \mathbb Z_q \setminus \lbrace 0 \rbrace $
    - Let $ h $ be a random generator of cyclic group $ G $ such that $ h $ is an element of $ \mathbb Z_q^* $
    - Let $ a $ be a random value and element of $ \mathbb Z_q^* $ and calculate $ g $ such that $ g = h^a $
    - Let $ r $ (the blinding factor) be a random value and element of $ \mathbb Z_p^* $ 
    - The commitment of value $ x $ is then determined by calculating $ C(x,r) = h^r g^x $ 
    - The generator $ h $ and resulting number $ g $ are known as the commitment bases, and should be shared along with $ C(x,r) $ with whomever wishes to open the value.
    - Pedersen commitments are also additionally homomorphic, such that for messages $ x_0 $ and $ x_1 $ and blinding factors $ r_0 $ and $ r_1 $ we have $ C(x_0,r_0) \cdot C(x_1,r_1)Â =Â C(x_0+x_1,r_0+r_1) $
  - Security attributes of the Pedersen Commitment scheme are perfectly *hiding* and computationally *binding*. An efficient implementation of the Pedersen Commitment will use secure Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite (prime) fields. 
  - Practical implementations usually consist of three algorithms: <code>Setup()</code> to set up the commitment parameters; <code>Commit()</code> to commit to the message using the commitment parameters and <code>Open()</code> to open and verify the commitment.

  - Complete: If the statement is true and both prover and verifier follow the protocol; the verifier will accept.
  - Sound: If the statement is false, and the verifier follows the protocol; the verifier will not be convinced.
