# Body 

One key property of a block chain system is that the nodes do not trust each other, meaning that some may behave in Byzantine manners. The consensus protocol must therefore tolerate Byzantine failures. The research literature on distributed consensus is vast, and there are many variants of previously proposed protocols being devloped for block chains. They can be largely clasified alsong a spectrum.[[1]]:
